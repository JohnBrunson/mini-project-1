# Mini Project 1: Build a simple web page from zero with a screenshot mockup as a guide. 

## Description

This is a simple HTML and CSS web page done to play with various features of HTML and CSS selectors/pseudo selectors. Very simple, not functional per se and was done from scratch. Goal was to get as close to the screenshot without looking at how it was generated.

## Installation

N/A: No installation. Simply for demo/learning purposes.

## Known Issues

Feel free to take a look at the code and offer constructive criticism. There's a few things I already know:
- This may not pass a WCAG test since I haven't tested for that. 
- There's probably a better way to do that hover effect. (Transition ALL probably isn't the right answer, but this was meant to demonstrate the hover effect and I didn't like the default.)
- Haven't figured out flexbox yet. I will probably play with that soon.
- Contact form does nothing. This is intentional.
- Links also do nothing. Technically, clicking on Contact Form should A. Update the web address to show that the user clicked it and B. Navigate to the form. I don't have a small enough device to show that this is working.
- YMMV with regard to how this shows on anything but a desktop. Smaller devices may appear a bit wonky. Again, not ideal, but... gotta start somewhere.
- For classmates that may be looking at this, yes, this doesn't quite match mockup. I wanted to see how far I could get on my own. Appearance differences should be minor.

Nothing to credit but MDN reference guides. Just trying to get better at my craft.
